After cloning the code of the repository:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

To force CMake to compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line 
   with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..

or use the explicit option:

 $ cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran ..
